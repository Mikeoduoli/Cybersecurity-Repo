"Antonis is absolutely brilliant. Really attentive and really quick to get things done."
"Technically astute."
"Excellent work. Quick turnaround. Great attitude."

That's a summary of all different feedback on completed jobs up to date, and that's the quality of service I love to provide.


Short CV:

For the last 10 years, I have being developing with Python, focusing on Data analysis projects. I'm accustomed with pandas, numpy and pretty much any related library. Before that, there is one decade's data-analysis and programming experience. I had been working with data collecting and processing tasks of all sorts using Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, VBA macros, VB, VBA, Python, custom scripts and professional licensed tools for web scraping (automated website reading), PDF scrapping, and editing, OCR (scrapping from image files, using Tesseract and Finereader), file/data management, 10.000+ entries on each project. Some jobs are: listing all the online offered lessons of high schools of the country, regional statistics jobs (for my country's Statistics Authority), automating daily or weekly tasks with extensive error handling, lead generation, scraping search engine results, social media scrapping and automating windows applications.

I use professional tools and custom developed solutions. I can speak directly to API, or read/parse the HTML output. I deploy to cloud (I use Amazon Web Services) for scaling and to perform geo-related searches, completing huge jobs in a few hours.

Tech Background:
I have hands on professional experience with AWS (EC2, S3, SQS etc), Latex, Matlab. I have strong Physics and Mathematics background. I speak HTML, JS, JSON, XML, C, C++, C#, Python (including Pandas, BeutifullSoup, boto3 for AWS, Django), VB, VBA (Advanced excel solutions), Google Apps Script, Bash (for SysAdmin tasks), CSS, and Windows Automation languages (i.e. Autoit). I have used hundreds of APIs including Google APIs (geolocation), and Twillio for marketing projects. I have delivered working solutions that use hundreds of proxy servers with management and recycling.
More recently, I have used and implemented OpenAI Whisper and ChatGPT APIs to web applications.

I have developed and deployed custom web applications based on Python (Django), SQL, Bootstrap4. I have included in, custom-developed genetic algorithms that perform live Operational Optimization.

I offer services rather than products. I'll design the best applicable solution for your task from scratch, run it on my own infrastructure, and deliver the results to you within time. The solution can also be developed as your own custom Web Application or Software as a Service (SaaS), "fully managed" by me to ensure working for as long as you wish. This means a custom made website or web API that do what you want them to do. Hosted, secured, login-ready, will work on any device (Mobile/Tablet/Mac/Windows/Linux any flavor), at reasonable price for development and maintenance. Also, I'm available for support on short notice, as long as our contract is active. I can also comply with a Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Through the years and through different projects and roles I have been in touch with hundreds of businesses and different verticals. The solutions I provide require me to understand the scope, and I find it easy to learn about and understand different subjects, be it Internet Marketing, SERP and SEO, Ships and Shipping Business, Agriculture, Financial and Tax, Logistics and Production Lines, Electronics and Robotics, on a level that allows me to easily communicate and requirements of new projects and tasks.




I'm a fluent English speaker, and I'm available on Upwork chat even when I'm on mobile. This means I will respond to chat messages immediately or within 2 hours, 5 AM to 8 PM (UTC). I am also available at Skype, Slack, or Teamviewer, upon request (After Hire).

I'm a business-minded trained professional that you can count to, to get the job done in the requested time, with 100% accuracy and attention to detail.

Contact me today to make it work, together.
